//! Library exports.
//!
//! Historically, this project kept most modules only in the binary crate (`main.rs`).
//! Exporting modules here allows:
//! - Reuse from additional binaries (e.g. OpenAPI exporters)
//! - Cleaner integration tests
//! - Single source of truth for types used by utoipa/OpenAPI generation
