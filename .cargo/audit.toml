  # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA timing attack vulnerability
  # Status: No fix available
  # Reason: Transitive dependency via sqlx-mysql. This project does not enable MySQL support.
  #         (sqlx-mysql is pulled in by sqlx macros internals.)
  "RUSTSEC-2023-0071",

  # RUSTSEC-2024-0421: `idna` accepts Punycode labels that do not produce any non-ASCII when decoded
  # Status: Fix requires upgrading transitive dependency chain.
  # Reason: Only pulled in via the optional `mongo` feature (mongodb -> trust-dns-* -> idna 0.2.x).
  #         The default build does not include MongoDB.
