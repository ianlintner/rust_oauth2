# Admin Dashboard

The server includes a simple admin UI:

- `GET /admin`

## What it shows

Typical panels include:

- Request/latency metrics
- Active tokens and clients (where available)
- Basic health status

## API endpoints

The admin UI also consumes JSON endpoints (implementation-specific). See [API Endpoints](../api/endpoints.md) for a full listing.
