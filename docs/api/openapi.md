# OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

This project ships an auto-generated OpenAPI specification (generated from the Rust code via `utoipa`).

Below is an embedded Swagger UI rendering of the spec that is committed to this repo:

<swagger-ui src="../assets/openapi/openapi.json" />

## Live server endpoints

If you're running the server locally you can also use:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8080/api-docs/openapi.json`
